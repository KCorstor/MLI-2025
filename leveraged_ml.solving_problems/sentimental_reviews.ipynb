    "## Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a machine learning model capable of classifying the sentiment of product reviews into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Amazon Product Review Dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/#complete-data), which includes reviews from various product categories. This dataset is widely used in sentiment analysis tasks and provides a rich set of real-world text data with varying sentiments. For simplicity and time, you may focus on a subset of this dataset, such as reviews from a specific category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [IMDB Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)\n",
    "- [Tweet Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/smile-twitter-emotion-dataset) â€” Not film-based but allows you to produce a similar classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A powerful language model that has revolutionized NLP tasks. It's pre-trained on a large corpus and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert): A lighter version of BERT that retains most of its performance but is faster and less resource-intensive, making it suitable for training on laptops and limited-resource environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Identify which words were most highly correlated with a sentiment.\n",
    "  - Assess whether the correlations can be used to build a more efficient heuristic-based alternative to your original classifier\n"
